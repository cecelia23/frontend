    <div id="content">In this paper, the authors propose a novel reversible 
            data hiding and double cycle embedding scheme resolving the 
            addressing problems. In predicting the pixel values the 
            algorithm in the proposed scheme uses the Euclidean distance 
            between the pixels assuming that the pixel values in an image 
            are very close to its nearest pixel values and vary gradually in 
            spatial domain. The predicting algorithm generalizes the 
            proposed schemes to be applicable for any size of blocks 
            which is the first time of the kind of predicting through 
            satellite pixels to the best of the authors' knowledge. The 
            block classification rule is also modified to ensure that no 
            candidate block is to be skipped from being bit-embedded 
            without sacrificing the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). 
            Furthermore, the authors adopted a zero maximization 
            techniques to increase the stego image quality [12]. </div>
